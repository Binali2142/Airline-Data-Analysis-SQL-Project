# Airline-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project

This project is focused on analyzing airline data to answer specific business questions using SQL. By querying the database, I extract insights about airline performance, geographic trends, and aircraft types.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to solve real-world airline business questions using SQL queries. This includes identifying top-performing airlines, analyzing aircraft and region statistics, and comparing performance between major manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus.

 ## Questions Solved
Below are the 5 questions addressed in this project, with a step-by-step explanation:

Qustion 1. Which airlines have the highest total landed weight for all regions combined?
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    Published_Airline, 
    SUM(Total_Landed_Weight) AS Total_Landed_Weight
FROM 
    Airline
GROUP BY 
    Published_Airline
ORDER BY 
    Total_Landed_Weight DESC;
```

Qustion 2. What is the average number of landings by aircraft body type across all regions?
```sql
SELECT 
    Aircraft_Body_Type, 
    AVG(Landing_Count) AS Avg_Landing_Count
FROM 
    Airline
GROUP BY 
    Aircraft_Body_Type;
```


Qustion 3. Identify the top 5 geographic regions based on total landed weight?
```sql
SELECT 
    GEO_Region, 
    SUM(Total_Landed_Weight) AS Total_Landed_Weight
FROM 
    Airline
GROUP BY 
    GEO_Region
ORDER BY 
    Total_Landed_Weight DESC
```

Qustion 4. Compare the total landed weight and landing counts for Boeing vs. Airbus across regions?
```sql
SELECT 
    Aircraft_Manufacturer, 
    GEO_Region, 
    SUM(Total_Landed_Weight) AS Total_Landed_Weight, 
    SUM(Landing_Count) AS Total_Landing_Count
FROM 
    Airline
WHERE 
    Aircraft_Manufacturer IN ('Boeing', 'Airbus')
GROUP BY 
    Aircraft_Manufacturer, 
    GEO_Region
ORDER BY 
    Total_Landed_Weight DESC;
```

Qustion 5. Which aircraft model contributes the most to total landed weight in the "Asia" region?
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 
    Aircraft_Model, 
    SUM(Total_Landed_Weight) AS Total_Landed_Weight
FROM 
    Airline
WHERE 
    GEO_Region = 'Asia'
GROUP BY 
    Aircraft_Model
ORDER BY 
    Total_Landed_Weight DESC
```

## How to Use
You can download the SQL queries file from this repository. <br>
Create Database called Arilines_data.<br>
Populate the Airline table with relevant data (e.g., airline names, regions, aircraft types, landed weights, etc.).<br>
Execute the queries on your SQL database to answer the business questions.

## Tools Used
SQL: For querying and analysis. <br>
Relational Database: To store and manage airline data.
